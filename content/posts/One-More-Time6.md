*“I’m sorry, but we couldn’t manage to bring back the body. Your husband was a brave man.”*  
I staggered to the bathroom while the whole world spun beneath me. The tile was so cold against my feet. Why was it so cold?  
*He’s gone.*  
Everything was so white. The bathroom sink slammed into my chest—or wait, did I fall into it?  
*He’s gone.*  
I leaned on the counter, my hands cold as ice. Why was it so cold?  
*He’s gone.*  
The person in the mirror was trembling. Their mouth was parted slightly, and their eyes were hollow. Was that me?  
*He’s gone.*  
My nose started to sting. My eyes started to water. My lungs started to stutter.  
*He’s gone… he’s gone. He’s gone he’s gone he’s gone he’s gone he’s gone. He’s gone…*  
His smile, his voice, his touch…  
“He’s gone?” The whisper escaped my lips.  
*There’s no way… he’ll be home soon. I’ll be in his arms soon… he’s fine.*  
“He’s okay.”  
*“…I’m sorry, but we couldn’t manage to bring back the body…”*  
“He’s gonna come home soon.”  
*“…Your husband was a brave man…”*  
I stared into my own eyes. They knew the truth. I knew from the moment I woke up this morning.  
*He’s dead. My husband is dead.*  
My knees gave way, but my elbows held firm to the sink.  
“No…” the whisper turned into a sob. Something was tightening around my chest. I couldn’t breathe. My lungs desperately wanted air, but lacked the strength to move. The me in the mirror had its mouth wide open. A muffled gasping sound brushed against my ears. Tears were streaming down my face.  
“Please… no. Please… God, no,” I pleaded as my hiccuping sobs voiced the words of the prayer. “Don’t take him from me yet.”  
I clenched my teeth. *I don’t want to deal with this… I don’t know how…*  
“Give him back!” I screamed.  
*Please… I can’t be without him.*  
“Dear God, please… just please.”  
My cries echoed through my thoughts. I just wanted to feel his warmth… to hear his voice…   
*Please. Not yet. Not him. Please don’t take him.*   
All just wailing moans.   
*Please God, just once more. Let me see him one more time.*  
My legs sprung up like a toy frog. My head jarred against the mirror as my forehead slammed into it. I squeezed my eyes shut.  
“Please,” I whimpered. “Please, God… just one more time.”   
My stomach lurched enough to frighten my eyes open, yet there was only darkness. I was falling… falling through the mirror. I couldn’t move and I couldn’t make a sound.   
Suddenly, the world was still. My vision was consumed by the figure standing right in front of me. It was him… he was smiling, but his eyes looked so sad.  
As soon as I arrived, I was thrown back again—now with my back against the cold bathroom tiles. My head throbbed.  
“No…” I murmured.  
Dazed, I struggled back up to the mirror. There was just me in it.   
*But he was there…*  
“No please…” I whined.  
*I didn’t get to talk to him… I didn’t get enough time.*  
“Please just once more!”
